This package is under construction and (will) contain functions for partitionning in space occurrences datasets for multiple taxa in order to compare their genetic patterns for example.


For installing the package:
First install the package devtools if necessary.
Then:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("gdauby/genmap")
```


An example dataset containing coordinates (decimal degrees) and taxa information

```{r}
library(genmap)

data(data.used)

data.used

```

The function grid_couting_tax is used for partitionning the data into a grid of a given resolution

```{r}
results <-
  grid_couting_tax(data = data.used ,long = "lon", lat = "Lat", sp = "ID_Species", resolution = 10)


```
